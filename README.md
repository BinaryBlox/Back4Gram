# Instagram Clone in SwiftUI

[Apple](https://www.apple.com/) has just released its new programming language called [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and keeping the commitment to deliver high compatibility, high manutenability and easier development, we created this Template so you can learn how to use the new language along with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to achieve your goals.

This application mimics the basic operations of [Instagram](https://instagram.com), while using Parse resources to make everything easier.

# Learn it from scratch!

We also created a series of [Blog Posts](https://blog.back4app.com/) to help you learn how to develop this template yourself.
Those posts go in detail on how to crate the UI structures, call GraphQL quries and Mutations and bind everything together.
